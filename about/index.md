Hi! I'm [Ben][1] and I am a mechanical and software engineer at [KISSsoft AG][2] in Switzerland. I've been a professional software engineer specialized in numerical computations with C++ since 2010 and head of the software development department since 2018. With this blog, I would like to share my experiences and thoughts about different kinds of topics of a mechanical engineer in the area of software development. I would be glad if I could trigger some interesting discussions. So don't hesitate to comment a post, or contact me directly via [GitHub][3], [LinkedIn][1], or [Twitter][4].
