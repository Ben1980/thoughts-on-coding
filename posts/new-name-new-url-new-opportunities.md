Welcome back to a new post on thoughts-on-coding.com. Yes, you've read correctly. I changed the URL of my blog (thoughts-on-cpp.com will stay valid, don't worry). I did this because I wanted to broaden the scope of my blog.

Not only writing about implementing algorithms in C++ but also writing about other topics in other programming languages (yes you're right ... other languages!!). But don't worry if you're interested in C++ related topics only, I will still have a strong focus on C++ because it's an awesome language and it's still my profession. I just want to keep this blog open to new opportunities writing about coding in general. So I hope you still stay tuned on thoughts-on-coding.com for my next post about coding soon.
